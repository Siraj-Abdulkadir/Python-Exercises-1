# Music Playlist Manager
Scenario:
Youâ€™re creating a Python program to manage a music playlist for your friends. The program will allow adding songs, displaying the playlist, and calculating total playtime.


# Level 1: Easy
Focus: Variables, Lists, Strings, If-Else
List Doc: Python Lists
Task:
Create an empty list called playlist.
Write a function add_song that takes a song title as input and adds it to the playlist.
Write another function show_playlist to display all songs in the playlist.
Use an if-else condition to check if the playlist is empty before displaying songs.


# Level 2: Intermediate
Focus: Dictionaries, Tuples, Loops, Functions
Task:
Expand the program to store more details about each song: title, artist, and duration (in minutes).
Use a dictionary where the song title is the key and a tuple (artist, duration) is the value.
Write a function total_duration to calculate the total length of the playlist in minutes.

# Level 3: Advanced
Focus: Sets, User Input, While Loops, Conditional Logic
Task:
Allow the user to interactively add songs to the playlist through a menu system.
Ensure no duplicate song titles using a set.
Write a function search_song to check if a specific song exists in the playlist and display its details.
Add an option to remove a song from the playlist
